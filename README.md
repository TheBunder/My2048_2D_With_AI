# My2048_2D_With_AI

This repository contains My2048_2D_With_AI, a continuation of my previous 2048 game project ([https://github.com/TheBunder/my2048_2D]). This version incorporates a game-solving algorithm using the minimax approach, allowing the game to play itself.  This enhancement was inspired by a suggestion from my father, which led me to learn about recursion and implement it in this project.  I was even invited to present this implementation to my class.

## About the Project

This project builds upon my earlier 2048 game, adding an automated game-solving capability.  After learning about recursion, I applied this technique to create a minimax algorithm that guides the game to play optimally (or near-optimally).  This project demonstrates my ability to learn new concepts and apply them to improve existing projects.

## Key Features

*   **2048 Gameplay:**  The core gameplay of 2048 remains the same.  Combine tiles with the same value to reach the 2048 tile.
*   **Minimax Algorithm:**  The game features a built-in minimax algorithm that strategically chooses moves to maximize the player's score (or in this case, the algorithm's score). *It's important to note that this is a game-solving algorithm, not a true "Artificial Intelligence" in the machine learning sense.*
*   **Automated Play:**  The game is set to play itself using the minimax algorithm.
*   **2D Array Implementation:**  The game board is represented using multi-dimensional arrays.
*   **ASCII Art Visuals:**  The game uses ASCII art for its graphical representation.

## How to Run

1.  Download the executable file (`My2048_2D_With_AI.exe`) from this repository.
2.  Run the executable.

## Technical Details

This game utilizes multi-dimensional arrays to represent the game board. The minimax algorithm explores possible moves using recursion to a certain depth and evaluates the resulting game states to choose the best move.  The game's visuals are created using custom-designed ASCII art.

## Development Notes

This project was a significant learning experience, particularly in understanding and implementing recursion and the minimax algorithm.  I'm grateful for the suggestion that led to this improvement and the opportunity to share my work with my class.
